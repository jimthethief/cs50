Open CSV File // read contents into memory
Open DNA Sequence File // read contents into memory

name, AGAT, AATG, TATC
first row = name
remaining rows = STR codes

// Python's csv module has a reader function (read file as series of lists)
// and DictReader function (read file as series of dictionaries)

// Python's sys module gives access to sys.argv for command line arguments
    - 1st arg is DNA database (CSV file)
    - 2nd arg is DNA sequence (txt file)

// Once text file 'f' is opened using open(filename) [open(f)], read its contents with f.read()

For each STR [AGAT, AATG, TATC] - compute the longest run of consecutive repeats in DNA sequence
Compare the totals of these counts against each row in the CSV file to search for match

// For each position [index in list] in the sequence - compute how many times the STR repeats from that position:
// So for each position, keep checking successive substrings until STR no longer repeats

// Handy functions for this:
    - len(s) calculates length of string
    - s[i:j] takes string s and returns substring with all chars from the ith char up to (not inc.) jth char

Save STR counts in a data structure - list or dictionary
// if match is found
    - for each row, check if each STR count matches - if so, print name of match
// else print no match

// int(x) takes the string x and turns it into an integer e.g. int('2') returns 2 as int
// to confirm a match, you'll need to check every column except the 1st(which is the name)
